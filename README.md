# Iris Data Analysis Project

This project performs data analysis on the Iris dataset using Python. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**:
   - Load the Iris dataset from sklearn and save it as `iris.csv`.
   - Load the `iris.csv` file using pandas and explore the data.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate basic statistics using pandas `.describe()`.
   - Group the data by the `species` column and calculate the mean of numerical columns.

3. **Data Visualizations**:
   The following plots are generated to visualize the dataset:
   - **Line chart**: Average petal length per species.
   - **Bar chart**: Average sepal width per species.
   - **Histogram**: Distribution of petal length.
   - **Scatter plot**: Sepal length vs petal length, with different colors for each species.

4. **Findings & Observations**:
   - Setosa species have smaller petal lengths compared to Versicolor and Virginica.
   - There is a positive relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length across all species.
   - Petal Length shows a bimodal distribution.
   - Setosa has the highest average Sepal Width among the species.
